# Catboost
Main advantages of CatBoost:
--------------
Implementing Catboost for titanic dataset.

The motivation for using Catboost was Sits superior quality when [compared](https://github.com/catboost/benchmarks/blob/master/README.md) with other gradient boosting methods for many benchmark datasets.

The code also provides some basic steps for data preprocessing.


The repo also provides charts for SHapely Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values.

## Future Work

- [ ] Add pipeline to check the impact of data preprocessing
- [ ] Add other models for benchmarking
